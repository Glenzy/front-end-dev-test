# Front-end Developer Test 
This repo contains a front-end developer job test for Telstra. React Slingshot was chosen because it contains all the necessary boiler plate to use Redux and Scss. This is a very basic shopping cart example of a responsive React/Redux app. 

* This app is WCAG2.1 AA Compliant
* Fully responsive on all devices
* It only displays published products
* It removes and replaces products as they're added and removed from the cart
* It uses standard Bootstrap 4 style semantic markeup

## Tech stack

* React 16.4.2
* Redux 4.0.0
* Jest  23.5.0
* Bootstrap-scss 4.2.1
* Posed ^4.5.0 
* Enzyme 3.5.0
* Sass
* Webpack
* Babel 7.0

These were all chosen because these are what I'm most comfortable using. As stated above this particular React app bootstrap comes with all the necessary boiler plate code for Redux and even React Dom router, which makes things easy. Testing was done using Enzyme and Jest. 

## For installation use npm
1.  `npm start install`
2.  `npm start`

## For testing
1.  `jest test`
